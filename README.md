Wheel Of Fortune Sound Player for Android

This is a small, standalone Android app. It plays some common Wheel of Fortune sound effects for use with a Wheel of Fortune game.

Note: This was created for use at our local high school for the senior party Wheel of Fortune room. We have a large wheel, and the kids come in and play to win prizes. The sound effects add to the ambience of the room.

This small app was built in Eclipse, and compiles and runs on android 4.2 or newer.

Enjoy!

Fork and improve, if you are so inclined.
